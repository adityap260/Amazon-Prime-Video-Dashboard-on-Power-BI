# Amazon Prime Video - Dashboard
## Problem Statement

Optimizing Content Strategy on Amazon Prime Video through Comprehensive Data Visualization

Context: Amazon Prime Video hosts a vast library of content, including movies, TV shows, and original programming. With the platform’s extensive user base, it is essential to analyze content performance and user engagement across various dimensions such as geography, genre, and release year. However, the sheer volume of data makes it challenging to extract actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions on content acquisition, marketing, and user engagement.

Despite the availability of detailed data on content types, ratings, genres, and geographical distribution of viewership, Amazon Prime Video lacks a streamlined method to visualize and analyze this data effectively. The absence of a robust analytical tool has led to difficulties in identifying key trends, underperforming content, and opportunities for content diversification.

The objective is to utilize a Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze key metrics of Amazon Prime Video’s content library. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to:

    Assess the popularity of content across different countries.
    Examine trends in content ratings and genres over time.
    Identify which types of content (movies vs. TV shows) are most popular.
    Analyze the relationship between content type, genre, and viewer ratings.
    Guide strategic decisions related to content acquisition, marketing focus, and regional content customization.

Key Metrics to be Included:

    1. Total number of titles (movies and TV shows).
    2. Content distribution by release year and genre.
    3. Viewer ratings segmented by content type and age rating.
    4. Geographic analysis of viewership patterns.
    5. Genre popularity and its correlation with ratings.

Expected Outcomes: The Power BI dashboard will provide Amazon Prime Video with:

    A clear understanding of which content genres and types resonate most with viewers in different regions.
    Insights into how viewer ratings vary across content types and age ratings, informing content development and marketing strategies.
    The ability to track changes in content popularity over time, helping to forecast future trends.
    Data-driven recommendations for content acquisition and localization strategies based on regional preferences.

Target Audience:

    Content Strategy Teams
    Marketing and Regional Teams
    Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Teams
    Executive Leadership

By leveraging this Power BI dashboard, Amazon Prime Video will be better equipped to refine its content strategy, improve viewer engagement, and optimize its content offerings based on comprehensive data analysis.
